# Changelog

## Unreleased

* Add the ability to read the error status registers and support for error interrupts via `SCB`
* [*breaking change*] Rename the package to `bxcan-ng`

### Fixes

* Mask out all reserved bits in `set_bit_timing` before writing the register.

## [0.7.0 - 2022-05-30](https://github.com/stm32-rs/bxcan/releases/tag/v0.7.0)

### New Features

* [*breaking change*] Add support for using the second RX FIFO.
  * The `Rx` type has been renamed to `Rx0`, and an `Rx1` type has been introduced that accesses the second FIFO.
  * `enable_bank` now takes the `Fifo` the filter should be assigned to as an additional argument.
* Implement the `embedded-hal` 0.2.7 CAN traits.

### Other Changes

* [*breaking change*] Removed the `embedded-can-03` feature as the `embedded-can` crate is deprecated.
* [*breaking change*] Use a new `OverrunError` type as the receive error instead of `()`.

## [0.6.2 - 2021-11-15](https://github.com/stm32-rs/bxcan/releases/tag/v0.6.2)

### Fixes

* Enter initialization mode when constructing a `CanBuilder` ([#49]).

## [0.6.1 - 2021-11-15](https://github.com/stm32-rs/bxcan/releases/tag/v0.6.1)

### New Features

* Updated to defmt 0.3.0 ([#47]).

[#47]: https://github.com/stm32-rs/bxcan/pull/47

## [0.6.0 - 2021-09-05](https://github.com/stm32-rs/bxcan/releases/tag/v0.6.0)

### New Features

* Add `CanConfig::set_automatic_retransmit` function to enable or disable automatic frame retransmission ([#42]).
* [*breaking change*] Remove `transmit_and_get_mailbox` in favor of an improved `transmit` method ([#40]).
  * `Can::transmit` now returns a `TransmitStatus` struct, which contains the dequeued frame and
    the mailbox the new frame was placed into.
* [*breaking change*] Make `CanConfig` harder to misuse ([#37]):
  * Methods now take `self` by value.
  * The `CanConfig` struct is now `#[must_use]`.
  * `CanConfig` leaves init mode on drop, and enables the peripheral when `.enable()` is called.
  * These changes make it very hard to forget to enable the peripheral after configuring, which was
    a common mistake in previous versions.
* [*breaking change*] Replace `Can::new` with `Can::builder`, which makes it harder to forget enabling the peripheral ([#46]).

### Other Changes

* [*breaking change*] Make `Can::clear_sleep_interrupt` and `Can::clear_wakeup_interrupt` take `&self` instead of `&mut self`.
* [*breaking change*] Gate `embedded_can` impls behind the `embedded-can-03` Cargo feature.
* [*breaking change*] Gate defmt support behind the `defmt` Cargo feature.
* [*breaking change*] Removed `Can::configure` in favor of `Can::modify_config` ([#36]).

### Fixes

* The `Can::enable_interrupt` and `Can::disable_interrupt` functions now manipulate the correct bits in the interrupt
  enable register ([#29]).

### Misc

* Improve documentation of interrupts ([#30]).
